========================================================================================================
Problem 1 

 1 - Define the problem and perform exploratory Data Analysis 
    
    •	Check shape, Data types, statistical summary 
    •	Univariate analysis 
    •	Multivariate analysis 
    •	Use appropriate visualizations to identify the patterns and insights 
    •	Key meaningful observations on individual variables and the relationship between variables.

2 - Data Pre-processing (Prepare the data for modelling): 
  
    •	Missing Value Treatment (if needed) 
    •	Outlier Detection (treat, if needed) 
    •	Feature Engineering 
    •	Encode the data 
    •	Train-test split

3 - Model Building 

    •	Linear regression
    •	Apply linear Regression using Sklearn 
    •	Using Stats models Perform checks for significant variables using the appropriate method 
    •	Create multiple models and check the performance of Predictions on Train and Test sets using R-square, RMSE & Adjust R-square.

3 - Model Building and Compare the Performance of the Models

    •	Build a Logistic Regression model 
    •	Build a Linear Discriminant Analysis model 
    •	Build a CART model 
    •	Prune the CART model by finding the best hyperparameters using GridSearch 
    •	Check the performance of the models across train and test set using different metrics 
    •	Compare the performance of all the models built and choose the best one with proper rationale
